I created the HTML file with div tags and classes to help categorize the 6
song attributes. The markup allows future developers to easily change the display
of a specific category of song information with CSS. The HTML is semantically
correct, as the last opened tag is the first closed. Additionally, I added an
AllMusic ratings category to provide statistics on how AllMusic has ranked these
songs. Furthermore, I added footer and address tags to provide relevant contact
information for the students who completed this lab (Teddy Clark).

I adopted a markup for XML similar to that of the HTML document from part 1 in
order to minimize the number of changes I would need to make in part 2. The XML
is semantically correct, as elements are properly nested with the last opening
tag being the first tag closed and all XML attributes are quoted. Additionally,
I added an AllMusic ratings category to provide statistics on how AllMusic has
ranked these songs. Furthermore, I added footer and address tags to provide
relevant contact information for the students who completed this lab (Teddy Clark).

In the CSS file, we first used display:inline-block in order to organize the different
sections into columns. Then, if any columns need to be resized, they were resized 
later with class specific selectors. In order to make the infomation line up into 
rows, we made the containers for each li in the different columns the same size. 
This made sure they all lined up horizontally regardless of font size. Finally, the 
images had to be resized to make them fit horizontally on the page and to reduce the
amount of scrolling required to view the whole list.

1. Create a README file, and in it explain the reasoning for the markup you chose and explain how your HTML is semantically correct.
2. explain the reasoning for the markup you chose and be prepared to explain how your XML is semantically correct.
3. Using comments in your file(s), and in your Readme file, explain the logic for the markup you have chosen and make sure your markup is well documented.
4. As above add any comments to your Readme file.
